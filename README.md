# ✅ Interactive To-Do List App (with Local Storage)

A clean and functional To-Do List application built with core web technologies. This project is a perfect demonstration of **DOM manipulation** and **client-side data persistence** using the browser's Local Storage API.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Task Management:** Allows users to easily add and delete tasks.
* **Task Completion:** Tasks can be marked as complete with a toggle.
* **Data Persistence:** Tasks are automatically saved to **Local Storage**, so they remain on the list even after the user closes and re-opens the browser.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with a clean CSS layout for accessibility on all devices.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Structure of the to-do list container and input form.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling for a modern look and feel, including a gradient background.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla):** Implements all core logic, including adding, checking, deleting tasks, and handling all Local Storage interactions.
